            <img ng-src="assets/img/disasterIcon.jpg" style="float:right;height:442px;position:relative;"/>

            <h4 style="line-height:150%;"> Many companies sell products, 
        
        many organizations raise money for a good cause, few combine them. Case Relief, through sales of phone cases, contributes a percentage 
        of each sale to disaster relief organizations. The advantage over the traditional phone case sales company that Case Relief has is that 
        it offers a guilt free purchase. The advantage over traditional charity companies is that Case Relief offers something to show for a donation. 
        These guilt free purchases represent cost free advertisement of the company through its branded cases, and the cause represents an incentive to give and tell. 
        <br />

Mission statement: 
Case Relief’s goal is to provide relief to those in disaster areas by becoming the go-to source for low priced phone protection
         supplies and donating as much money possible to organizations specializing in disaster relief and recovery.
